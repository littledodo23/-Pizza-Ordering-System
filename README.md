 -Pizza-Ordering-System
2nd year project ,The Pizza Ordering System is a JavaFX-based application that allows customers to place pizza orders for To-Go, Delivery, and Seated options. The system calculates order prices based on pizza size, number of toppings, and additional service fees.
🚀 Features

## 📋 Three Ordering Options:

To-Go: Standard order pricing.

Delivery: Includes trip rate and zone-based pricing.

Seated: Includes service charges and number of people.

🍕 Pizza Customization: Customers can select pizza size (Small, Medium, Large) and toppings (Onions, Olives, Green Peppers).

💰 Automatic Price Calculation: The system dynamically calculates the order price based on selections.

🖥️ Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with JavaFX for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

📜 Sorting & Printing Orders: Orders are stored in a list, sorted, and displayed.
